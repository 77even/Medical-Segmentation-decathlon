Medical Segmentation Decathlon: Effective VNet-based 3D Segmentation Model of the Liver

Project overview；

（1）Developed a 3D segmentation algorithm pipeline based on MONAI with VNet model and generalised sieve loss function 

（2）Optimised the loss function by combining focus loss to achieve test time enhancement to improve the segmentation performance of small tumours

（3）Combine UNet and HighResNet to construct a segmentation consensus model to achieve a final segmentation Dice coefficient of 0.81 for more accurate and stable prediction
